Let's say you're getting an error with your data or search results. It may be an error that other Magento/Algolia users experience. On this page, we've put together the solutions and background understanding of the most common problems our users have.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
If you haven't yet installed the extension, or followed the steps in <a href="https://community.algolia.com/magento/doc/m2/getting-started/">getting started</a>, please do so before continuing.
</div>

The types of errors are varied, affecting both new and long-time users. Many of the problems are serious but actually require only a few simple steps to resolve. As you go along, we provide you with these steps as well as links to help you further understand the subject.

If you have more precise questions, check out our <img style="display:inline-block;width:25px;" src="../../../img/algolia-logo-new.svg" class="img-responsive" alt="">search bar above. You can also browse our docs ([Magento docs](https://community.algolia.com/magento/doc/m2/getting-started/), [Algolia docs](https://www.algolia.com/doc/)) or our [FAQ](https://community.algolia.com/magento/faq/).

## My data is missing or not up to date
<div class="alert alert-info">
I've <a href="https://community.algolia.com/magento/doc/m2/getting-started/">installed the extension and followed all of the steps</a> - configured my data, selected my settings, and added a search bar to my site. But nothing shows up. I search and nothing appears.
</div>

One possible problem here is with the indexing and/or queueing processes: Did you *upload your data*? Did you *reindex*? Enable *queueing*?

#### Uploading Data

Explain

#### Reindexing

Explain

#### Queue / Cron

Explain

## My data is too large

#### Data needs to be broken up into 10K chunks
Explain

#### Queueing does that for you automatically
Explain
