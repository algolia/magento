You're getting an error but have no idea where to start looking! Well, we've put together here a page that tries to address all kinds of problems - unrelated to data and search.

<div class="alert alert-info" style="white-space: pre-wrap">If you haven't already read our <a href="https://community.algolia.com/magento/doc/m2/faq-support-data/">data-based FAQ</a>, please do so before continuing. Many problems can be solved by setting up your data, indexes, and queue properly.

Also, if you haven't yet installed the extension, or followed the steps in <a href="https://community.algolia.com/magento/doc/m2/getting-started/">getting started</a>, please do so before continuing.

Lastly, if you are still having troubles after having gone through this page, please check out our <img style="display:inline-block;width:25px;" src="../../../img/algolia-logo-new.svg" class="img-responsive" alt="">search bar above to find more answers. You can also browse our sidebar, or check out our <a href="https://community.algolia.com/magento/faq/">Magento FAQ</a>, or the <a href="https://www.algolia.com/doc/">Algolia docs</a>.

## Development Environment

f you are not live, you can use the production index in development.
If you are live and can't afford a testing index, I fear there is a problem with the business case.
Anyway, adding an attribute to the index shouldn't affect other index users.
